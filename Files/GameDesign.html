DimensionalRift is a VR arcade game that is played with two handheld controllers, that is represented
in the game by a shield and a sword. <br><br>
The game takes place at a spacestation that the player has to defend
against incoming projectiles which spawns through a portal. 
<br><br>
DimensionalRift is available for free on
<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/580630/Dimensional_Rift/" target="_blank">Steam.</a>
<br><br><br><br><br>
This game was a school project that lasted for about 3 months on 50% worktime, 
where I worked as a designer and lead programmer.
<br><br>
I took responsiblity over making sure that different parts of the game worked when put together. I was 
involved in all parts of the programming, supporting and helping out, and also created functionality for 
datahandeling such as score, highscore and save/load, as well as implementing the UI elements.

<p>SuperSpy2D is a simplistic 2D-sideview game, played with keyboard or controller.</p>
<p>The gameplay revolves around the player, as a spy, using stealth to sneak into buildings and steal stuff, without getting detected by patroling guards.</p>
<br>
<p>This game was made by a group of 3 as a school project,that lasted 6 months on 50% worktime.</p>
<p>In this project I was involved in every aspect of the game, except sound, with atleast 50% of the game create by me.</p>
<p>I did most of the AI, made and implemented animations, created assets and levelmechanichs, menufunctionality with profiles, save and load, and highscore.</p>

System for 2D game creation with SDL2 | C/C++ | School project<br>
</h2>
<p align="center">Created winter -16/17</p>
<p align="center"><a href="https://github.com/oathmountain/Prog3">GitHub Repo</a></p>
<div class="textcontent">
<p>This project was made for a school programming course in C/C++.</p>
<p>The asignment was to create a system including base classes from which you could create 
multiple, similar 2D-games, and it had to be made by using the SDL2 libraries.</p>
<p>It also had a requirement that implementations should only be able to create objects 
dynamically and for value semantics to be forbidden.</p>
<p>The program includes gameloop, user triggered events, collision detection and both static, 
movable and animated sprites amongst other functions.</p>
<p>The implementation of the system in main is just to display functionality.</p>

Path-Finding in a map with A* algorithm | C++ | Hobby project<br>
</h2>
<p align="center">Created spring -17</p>
<p align="center"><a href="https://github.com/oathmountain/PathFinding">GitHub Repo</a></p>
<div class="textcontent">
<p>This is a piece of code that I wrote because I wanted to try out an assignment I found 
online when reading up on algorithms.</p>
 
<p>It is a method that implements an A* search algorithm to find and return the shortest 
path between two points in a 2-dimensional map. </p>
<p>The method takes a start and goal point, a pointer to a map as well as its height and width, 
a pointer to write the path to and the max amount of steps the path may take.</p>
<p>In the map traversable points are indicated by 1, and none-traversable by 0.</p>
<p>It either returns the amount of steps needed to reach the goal after writing the path to 
the pointer or -1 if it can not reach the goal.</p>

Saving map locations | Java-Swing | School project<br>
</h2>
<p align="center">Created spring -16 with a classmate</p>
<p align="center"><a href="https://github.com/oathmountain/Prog2">GitHub Repo</a></p>
<div class="textcontent">
<p>This project was made for a school programming course in Java.</p>

<p>The asignment was to create a system, with the help of Swing, that allows the user to
open an image and define locations on it with the mouse.</p>
<img src="Images/Prog2-ScrS1.jpg">

<p><br><br><br>The locations would include an array of options, like categories and descriptions. 
They alse had to be able to be displayed, or hidden, in various states.</p>
<img src="Images/Prog2-ScrS2.jpg">

<p><br><br><br>The program uses a lot of listeners and Swing components, has both add and delete options,
a search by name function as well as a function that searches an area around a mouse click.</p>
<img src="Images/Prog2-ScrS3.jpg">


<p><br><br><br>It also have save and load options, and it prompts the user if changes has been made when
the user tries to exit the program.</p>
