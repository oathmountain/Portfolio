<h2>So, who am I?</h2>

<p>At my core I am really a soft hearted and playful guy, always trying to help other people in one way
or the other. The kind of guy others turn to for support and advice. Partly because I am a good listener,
but also because I have a strong sense of empathy, as well as a mind that is great at see things in different
perspectives, which really helps me connect with someone and guide them through to new posibilities.</p>

<p>Beside being a big softie, I am also somewhat of an anti-norm fighter. I tend to always question behaviours
and the traditional way of doing things, which so often does not make sense at all, to instead find more optimal
ways to engage in the world.</p>
 
<p>With a wide area of interests and a yearning to always learn more and grow in everything I do, 
I always take on problems and challenges head on. Armed with great intuition and a mind of 
patterns, learning about new logic-based things has always been easy for me, which also makes 
me quite flexible and adaptable when it comes to, for example, programming languages.</p>

<p>But what I really love and am passionate about, is creativeness, in what ever shape or form
it might take. This is what drove me to become a game developer, to be able to create new experience
through the various means that build up games. The art, the gameplay, the world, the content. Games
really contains it all, and I love it.</p>
